# Portfolio Site

## Description
Dynamic portfolio page using Node and Express to showcase the great projects you've built. The site will contain a modern landing page, an about page where you'll have a chance to share contact info, practice your elevator pitch and talk a little about yourself, and a series of project pages to show off and detail at least your first five projects from this Techdegree.

## How-to Reference
You'll create a JSON file to store all the data about the projects you've created.

You'll use Pug to complete provided templates that utilize the JSON to generate the markup that is ultimately displayed in the browser.

You'll use Node.js and Express to:

Import the required dependencies
Link the JSON with the Pug templates
Set up routes to handle requests
Set up the middleware to utilize static files like CSS
Handle errors
Set up a server to serve the project
